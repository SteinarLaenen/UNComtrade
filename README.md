# UNComtrade
Some Python scripts which are useful for the UN Comtrade dataset

Install needed packages using conda: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

To create the adjacency matrix: `python create_adjacency_matrix.py`

Code mostly meant as started code. Feel free to copy it and use for your own purposes.

Information about the UN comtrade dataset can be found here: https://comtrade.un.org/

I've also written about the UN Comtrade database in Chapter 4 of my MSc thesis here. Section 4.1 in particular should help explain the UN Comtrade dataset: https://project-archive.inf.ed.ac.uk/msc/20193694/msc_proj.pdf
